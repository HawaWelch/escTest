The Explore Scientific ED102 Triplet CF was built for astrophotography.  This Apochromatic refractor telescope blends portability and effectiveness into a single, sleek program.  With an aperture of F/7, and focal amount of 714mm, deep sky targets such as the Lagoon Nebula happen to be perfect for this wide-field APO.

I've been using this telescope for astrophotography from my backyard since May of 2016, and since then We have enjoyed the quality of the photos produced with it.

Modest German equatorial astrophotography mounts such as the Orion Sirius EQ-G or Celestron AVX could have no problem handling this light in weight tube, with all your photography gear included.  I currently make use of a Sky-Watcher HEQ5 Mount with the ED102, which includes proven to be a winning combo.

# Explore Scientific ED102 CF Review

Selecting the right telescope for astrophotography could make all the difference on the planet.  After many hours of research reading evaluations, testimonials, and technical specs, I made a decision to update to the Explore Scientific ED102 Carbon Fibre F/7 Triplet Apochromatic Refractor.

I hope that review can help you try to make your telescope ordering decision easier, as I've provided examples of legitimate experience, and real photographs captured using this refractor. To be clear, this is actually the original Carbon Fibre model, the FDC1.  Since purchasing this telescope in 2016, Explore Scientific has produced a new FCD100 series version.

## Reliable Results and Sharp Images

First things primary.  My pursuits are in deep-sky astrophotography.  My absolute most desired activity is to invest a night time in the backyard photographing nebulae, galaxies and superstar clusters with my camera and telescope.  As the camera is definitely capturing photons on my astrophotography aim for of preference, I can relax and unwind in a yard chair and revel in the wonder of the night sky with a set of binoculars.

I just thoroughly enjoy the procedure for acquiring the images, as well as all of the work needed afterwards to produce the ultimate image.  Because of this, I need a high-quality telescope that could manufacture sharp, high-contrast photographs on a regular basis.

The image above showcases the gorgeous Orion Nebula, captured using the Explore Scientific ED102 CF from my backyard.  Messier 42 is a superb concentrate on for your DSLR and telescope, as a good stock camera will pick up the colourful details of this nebula in a short exposure.

## Quality Optics

The Explore Scientific ED102 CF FCD1 uses HOYA Extra-Low-Dispersion (ED) Cup with Enhanced Multi-Coatings. The triplet lens design means that the ED102 makes a flat field of watch for astrophotography

This telescope is a great choice for anyone thinking about capturing high-quality deep-sky DSLR astrophotography images.

Before upgrading to the ED102, my primary astrophotography telescope was an Explore Scientific ED80.  This 80mm triplet holds a special place in my own heart because it was my first proper astrophotography telescope. Over the course of 4 years, I photographed more than 50 deep-sky objects with it.

The Explore Scientific ED80 tops my set of best astrophotography telescopes for beginners.  I consider an apochromatic refractor to end up being the very best telescope for a rookie to dive into deep sky astrophotography with.

Needless to say, if you're looking to buy a professional telescope for astrophotography, have an excellent look at the products available from Explore Scientific.

## More Aperture, on a lightweight package

I just purchased the ED80's big brother in-may 2016 with hopes of increasing the quality and quality of my pictures. I wasted virtually no time and started using the brand new telescope for an outdoor astrophotography project right away.

Upgrading to the ED102 right from the ED80 was a fairly easy decision, as my own loyalty to Check out Scientific was earned over 5 years worth of imaging experience.

# My experience using this telescope

## Lightweight and solid

Due to the carbon fibre engineering, the ED102 is incredibly compact considering its size and the glass mixed up in construction of high-quality refractors.  The telescope requires just an individual counterweight on the contrary end of my Sky-Watcher HEQ-5.  This balancing act includes the excess fat of my Altair Starwave 50mm Guideline Scope, Altair GPCAM2 AR0130 Guide Video camera, and my Canon DSLR surveillance camera.  Do a comparison of that to the weight of my massive 8? Orion Astrograph Reflector which uses 2.5 counterweights at the end of the counterweight shaft.

The Sky-Watcher HEQ-5 Equatorial Mount handles this light-weight refractor easily, creating a rock-solid, smooth ride.  Slewing and imaging with this combo is tight and secure.

## 2? Dual-Speed Focuser

The 2? dual-speed rack-and-pinion focuser works together with a level of precision I became accustomed to after using the ED80.  The focuser tube includes plenty of travel and includes a calibrated scale.  That is especially valuable for astrophotographers, as I can quickly adjust my concentration to a prior nights imaging program, and then fine-tune employing BackyardEOS.  The adjustment screws within the tube let me control the strain of the focuser and lock the tube into place.

## Dielectric-Coated Star Diagonal

The current package because of this telescope on B & H Photo includes a 90 Dielectric-Coated Star Diagonal. This will come in extremely useful when performing the star alignment procedure at the start of my imaging program.

It provides a comfortable angle for visual observing as well, as possible rotate it found in the focuser tube to obtain the perfect job for your height and viewing position.  When my camcorder is mounted on the telescope, it really is connected directly to the focuser tube as the diagonal is not needed for astrophotography.

## Cradle and Dovetail

The ED102 comes with an adjustable cradle with a Vixen-style dovetail mount.  By unlocking the telescope from the cradle, you can properly and securely slide the ED102 up or right down to find an ideal balance for your products.  The handle also includes a cut-out to attach additional pieces of equipment such as a lead scope, finder or video camera.  I currently utilize the finder scope tube rings to carry my auto guiding system.

## Retractable Dew Shield

The ED102 carries a built-in retractable dew shield, which blocks out stray light in addition to protects the objective zoom lens from moisture.  With a twist, the dew shield locks into place.  After various uses with this telescope, I've observed the dew shield does not stay locked into place.  A straightforward fix is by using a elastic band at the base of the dew shield to prevent it from slipping.

Despite this minor annoyance, the overall build quality of this instrument is impressive.

# SUMMARY and Conclusions

I look forward to each and each and every time I get to put this telescope to use.  By the end of the day, the benefits this telescope makes in the form of astrophotography images is the real way of measuring its capabilities.  I take advantage of an Altair Lightwave 0.8X Reducer/Flattener when imaging with both my Canon DSLR or Altair Hypercam 183C camera through this telescope.  This even more flattens the discipline of viewpoint in my images and minimizes the telescope's focal duration for a wider discipline of view.

One way to improve the capacities of the ED102 would be to put in a motorized focuser such as Starlight feather touch focuser.  I saw the ED127 F/7.5 version of the telescope with this very addition at the Cherry Springs Star Party in 2017.  A motorized focuser really can come in helpful for precision concentrating during an imaging session.

The team at Explore Scientific is fantastic to manage.  The interaction and customer care I've received has produced a long lasting impression on me.  I could recommend the Explore Scientific ED102 CF to astrophotographers and visual observers looking for a high-top quality telescope that will deliver years of fun.  I am hoping that you identified this review helpful in some way and that you discovered a little more relating to this specific telescope.
